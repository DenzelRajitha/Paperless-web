                            Privacy<br>
                            Manual handling of personal information is highly unsafe and could lead to many safety and privacy issues.
                            Sharing contact details on pen and paper in public settings expose them to anyone, and it is impossible to guarantee that that information will not be misused.
                            When contact is information is shared digitally, it is secure with limited access to who can access it.
                            You will also have more control over which information you are willing to share if needed. 
                            <br><br>           
                            Convenience<br>
                            Maintaining manual contact information records come with many practical issues.
                            An organization that is supposed to maintain contact tracing information should allocate separate staff members to the task,
                            allocate resources and space to store the information, and also allocate a considerable amount of time for the task. 
                            A digital solution such as Paperless increases efficiency, reduces the resources needed, and there will be no queues or
                            wasting time at the entrance for both the staff and the customers. 
                            <br><br>
                            No Paper clutter<br>
                            Keeping the manual records and maintaining them will consume many papers,
                            increasing your paper clutter and making a large negative impact on the environment.
                            By using a Paperless contact tracing app, there will be zero use of papers and minimum impact for the environment.

                04. Contact Tracing in Paperless?
                </h3>

                    <p class="answer">
                            Contact Tracing is an important public health strategy to combat communicable diseases such as COVID-19.
                            Due to recent surges of COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka, the government has mandated logging their contact information prior to entering public places.
                            However, the lack of respect many Sri Lankans have towards privacy and personal information is making the public sharing of personal information a huge privacy issue.
                            There is a massive misuse of personal data shared for contact tracing at the moment,
                            including harassment of women and unsolicited marketing campaigns mainly using phone numbers.
                            Public exposure of personal information such as the NIC can also lead to more serious issues such as identity theft.<br>
                            Paperless Contact Tracing is an entry-point to a paperless and secure solution to contact tracing by solving the above issues.
                            It is a decentralized but shared contact tracing platform which can be used to collect and log personal information in public spaces.<br>
                            Paperless offers a safe, seamless, and hassle-free process for both parties.
                            Personal information logged through the Paperless Contact Tracing app will not be disclosed to anyone except for an
                             authorized party with a legitimate request related to COVID-19.

                        Every phone number is registered to a certain person, 
                        since the Government does not allow the use of unregistered phone numbers in Sri Lanka. 
                        It is an easy and secure way to collect contract tracing information. With the current manual methods, 
                        you cannot guarantee that everyone will be adding accurate personal information. 
                        Therefore, Paperless is not only more secure, but also more reliable.

                        when you register with the platform. 
                        We plan to conduct an independent audit of the way we handle data and publish those findings to the public soon.
                        We also try to store personal information only on your devices as much as possible. Also, we are in the process 
                        to encrypt everything, so even we cannot access your personal information.<br>
                        The Paperless Contact Tracing method ensures a high level of privacy and safety, 
                        especially when compared to the manual method currently being done.<br>

                        Simply put, one of the main objectives of this app is to protect the data privacy of its users. 
                        While we reinstate that we do not sell our data to third parties, a number of steps are taken to maintain our objective.<br>
                        We have decentralized the user data—User data will not be stored in a single server. (Please add)<br>
                        We entirely delete all user records from the merchant’s end after 2 months.<br>
                        Users have the total authority to decide which information need to be passed to the merchants

                        We can understand your skepticism and it is absolutely okay. 
                        You might be thinking along the lines of, “if I am not paying, I should be the product.” 
                        So, let us quickly explain why we do not charge from our users. We have many features lined up to 
                        release in the near future. Paperless Contact Tracing is only one feature that came with urgency due 
                        to the unsafe ways of personal information being handled currently. 
                        There will be features that may require payment in the future, but the Paperless Contact Tracing 
                        feature is not one of them.
